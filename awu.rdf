Title:  The Euler Equation Approach: Critical Implications of Recent Developments in the Theory of Intertemporal Choice 
Abstract:  The paper deals with the development of the mainstream theory of intertemporal choice based on the idea that 
individuals choose consumption and saving in order to maximize lifetime expected utility subject to an intertemporal budget 
constraint. This analytical framework rests on the theories developed in the 1950s by Modigliani and Friedman and revisited 
in the 1970s with the introduction of the rational expectations assumption. Starting with Hall (1978), the literature focused 
on testing the model relying on the first-order conditions of the optimization problem faced by the consumer — the Euler equation — 
and a number of empirical puzzles arose. Therefore, the subsequent decades were dedicated to progressively modifying the original model 
so as to render it able to explain the data. The paper argues that the introduction of highly specific assumptions, needed to reconcile 
theory and empirical evidence, has affected the generality of the implications that can be drawn from the model. Furthermore, the ever more 
substantial departure from the original formulation seems to have resulted in a gradual abandonment of the very premises on which the neoclassical 
approach to consumption analysis was built.

Title:  Revisiting the role and consequences of Econophysics from a Marxian perspective
Abstract:  The idea that economic phenomena are governed by stochasticity and uncertainty led to the extensive 
use of concepts and methods from the physical sciences that deal with non-deterministic patterns, giving rise 
to the multidisciplinary field of Econophysics. The last decade, several voices rose against it arguing that no 
new knowledge has been obtained and that the Econophysicists have merely ‘discovered’ what was already known in Economics. 
There also have been economists arguing that the mixture of physical models and economic ideas can still blossom and provide 
new insights into the study of Economics. In this paper, we attempt to reveal a different aspect of Econophysics, one that builds 
on its corroborative character and its role in criticizing neoclassical approach. In our view Econophysics can be used as a new enlarged 
version of Econometrics, as a set of methodologies to subject the economic models to logical and empirical tests. But, to do so, we argue, 
it is also necessary to ‘release’ this strict methodological research from any theoretical or ideological doctrine, including those neoclassical 
axioms so well incorporated in Economics. In view of this, we show that econophysical models by and large give further insights to discard the 
Marginalist paradigm point towards a different perception, closer to the old Classical and Marxian theories of political economy.

Title:  Investigating the Greek Unemployment from a Classical Perspective
Abstract:  This paper addresses the issue of unemployment in Greek economy from a Marxist perspective. 
Specifically, we focus on analysing the structure of the Greek labour market with respect to the results
of the memoranda and their relation to the current phase of capital accumulation. Rejecting the orthodox 
approaches to measuring and analysing unemployment, we first turn our focus to three indicators that are proposed 
by the BLS, calculating them in the case of the Greek labour market. Then, the three categories of stagnant, conjectural and 
latent reserve army are presented and respective unemployment rates are calculated for the Greek economy. Our conclusion is that 
the Marxian categories, not only capture the real dimension and size of the labour market, but they also contain information about 
changes in the labour force, that are not easily considered through the official indices.

Title:  Credit, money and economic growth: two volumes in honour of Lavoie and Seccareccia
Abstract:  This review article provides a brief outline of the content of
two recent volumes edited by Rochon and Bougrine in honour of Lavoie
and Seccareccia. Observations are then advanced on two points raised in
the two volumes, namely the effect of the monetary policies on income
distribution and the implications of the zero lower bound on the monetary
policy. Finally, some contributions focusing on secular stagnation are
commented on.
Classification-JEL: E12; E4; E5
Keywords: Credit, money, monetary policy and income distribution, effective demand and economic growth, secular stagnation.
