Title:  Some Factors Affecting US Capital Profitability over the Last Decades 
Abstract:  Over the last decades the progressive decline in long-term real interest rates has not been matched by a reduction in the rate of profits This has been seen as a puzzling phenomenon that calls for an explanation and has also questioned what has been called the â€œmonetary theory of distributionâ€\x{9D} (MTD) which, following Sraffa (1960, Â§44), stresses the monetary nature of the rate of interest and its effects on income distribution. The scope of this work is to advance some remarks on this phenomenon by referring to the case of the United States. We will star by taking a closer look at what actually happened to the US real interest rates and (observed) profit rates. We will then go on to discuss the relationships between money wages, interest rates and the profit rate in the Classical-Keynesian approach, focusing on the determinants of theprofits of enterprise. Finally, we will analyse the changes in some of these determinants over the last decades, among which manager remunerations and monopoly power, as well as the way in which the fruits of technical progress are distributed in the present stage of capitalism.

Title:  Ricardos and Marxs Conception of Absolute and Relative Value: A Critical Overview 
Abstract:  This paper examines Ricardos and Marxs views on absolute and relative value, focusing on the parallels and differences in their analysis of labor values. Next, it discusses Marxâ€™s ingenious but incomplete â€œsolutionâ€\x{9D} to the problem of how it is possible for a rigorous and consistent labor theory of value to operate in a competitive capitalist economy. It then gives an overview of Sraffaâ€™s seminal contribution to the problem of constructing an invariable standard of value which meets Ricardoâ€™s exacting criteria, as well as resolving Marxâ€™s transformation conundrumâ€”one which involves abandoning the labor theory of value. The latter comes at the heavy price of discarding those qualitative and dialectal (dynamic) elements in Marxâ€™s class-based and historical approach which, more so than the classical (surplus) approach, make it such a valuable tool for understanding the social (power) relations of capitalism, as well as cutting through its ideological obfuscations.

Title:  Reswitching in a Model of Extensive Rent 
Abstract:  This article presents an example of the reswitching of the order of fertility and of the order of rentability. Whether or not these orders differ from one another varies with distribution for certain parameter ranges in the example. This analysis emphasizes that more rent per acre is not necessarily associated with more fertile land and that the ranking of lands by fertility cannot, in general, be determined from only data on physical inputs and outputs for the available processes.

Title:  Elements of Risk in Classical Political Economy and Marx 
Abstract:  As against the established view in HET text books, elements of risk decision making were present in economic theory, long before Frank Knightâ€™s great contribution. Smith announced the importance of risk premium and analysed thoroughly the different kinds of â€œchances of profitâ€\x{9D} between lotteries, insurances, sea trade etc. Mill also recognised risk as a distinct element of profits of capital and distinguished two different sources of risk. Risky behaviour, although subordinated, is also investigated in Marxâ€™s work. Therefore, even if the distinction between insurable risks and non-insurable uncertainty is equivocal before 1921, substantial evidence of it is indeed perceptible long before.

Title:  The Macroeconomic Impact of Public Spending in Research and Development: An Initial Exploration for G7 and 15 Oecd Countries 
Abstract:  This paper aims to assess the macroeconomic effect produced by fiscal policies targeted at innovation-focused public spending. Specifically, we estimate the fiscal multiplier associated with public R&D investment. We also aim to evaluate whether public innovation investment can crowd in business investment in R&D and generate additional employment. We combine the Local Projection approach with fiscal shocks estimated using Structural Vector Autoregressive modelling by focusing on a panel of G7 and 15 OECD economies for the 1981-2017 period. Our results show that public R&D expenditure produces higher fiscal multipliers than those generally found in the economic literature which focuses on the different components of public spending. Our results also show that this type of public expenditure can generate spillover effects, by crowding in private R&D and generating a positive impact on employment level. Findings are confirmed even when fiscal expectations are included.

Title:  The Industrial Reserve Army and Wage Setting in China 
Abstract:  We propose a Marxist interpretation of wage setting in post-reform China and an account of the formation of its industrial reserve army (IRA). We discuss the party-state shifting strategies toward depeasantization and the social forms under which laborers were absorbed in nonagricultural activities. Far from experiencing the end of unlimited supplies of labor, China has built a massive IRA that has nonetheless the wage rate formation and the evolution of class struggle and state policies responding to it, which together explain the broad patterns of wage behavior in China.

Title:  Potential output measurement and structural unemployment (NAWRU) in the context of the European Union 
Abstract:  The potential output of an economy is a key concept in the context of the EU fiscal regulation, as its estimation is used to calculate the â€œstructuralâ€\x{9D} budget balances that determine the specific fiscal policy directions of individual countries. After providing an overview of the methodologies adopted in the context of the European institutions to estimate potential output, we discuss different meanings and interpretations of the concept, which reflect different theoretical standpoints. We highlight some problems related to the mainstream explanation and the paradoxical outcome that the estimated value for the theoretical magnitude, the one that should act as an attractor for the realized one, ends up being determined, mostly, by the realized, effective variable. Finally, we elaborate on the policy implications within the EU regulatory framework that ensue from the previously discussed issues, such as the prescription of restrictive fiscal policies, to comply with European fiscal rules, even in recessions.

Abstract:  This introduction provides a list of questions in order to highlight different aspects of Garegnaniâ€™s work and possible lines of advancement in the surplus approach. The questions concern 1) the criticism of the marginalist theory and the present state of the capital debate; 2) the separate determination of prices and outputs and Garegnaniâ€™s distinction between the relationships within the â€œcoreâ€\x{9D} of the surplus approach and the relations outside it; 3) the relationship between Sraffa and Marx; 4) growth theory; 5) the determinants of income distribution.

Title:  A note on capital obsolescence (and underutilization) in classical and neoclassical normal positions 
Abstract: On account of the relevance that in principle the size and composition of the existing stock of capital goods might have, we attempt to verify whether in the classical and neoclassical approach thereotical positions may retain their role as centres of gravity in situations of prolonged divergences between the existing capital stock and the size and/or physical composition of the set of means of production implied in normal magnitudes. The kind of divergence against which we will compare the one and the other theoretical system consists, in particular, in the maintenance in use of â€˜machinesâ€™ that have been rendered obsolete by the introduction of some change in the â€˜dominantâ€™ methods of production, i.e. the methods relevant to price determination, but which producers find it convenient to continue operating for the rest of their useful life.

Title: Pierangelo Garegnani: economics with a critical orientation 
Abstract: In this paper we will focus on some of the problems in the theory of value and distribution that Sraffa and Garegnani have tackled in their path-breaking works. In particular, the focus will be first on the identification of the cost-minimizing system of production from a set of technical alternatives and its properties in terms of the general rate of profits and the set of relative prices corresponding to a given real wage rate. Next we will discuss briefly in highly abstract terms and in the context of an utterly simple one-good economy the process of the diffusion of new techniques and the gradual elimination of old techniques, which once were cost minimizing, but no longer are. The issue at hand is an aspect of what Schumpeter called â€œcreative destruction.â€\x{9D} Finally, we will analyse the non-conventional (that is, non-marginalist) findings in capital theory put forward by Sraffa (1960) and further elaborated by Garegnani (1970, 1990 etc.). When their theoretical possibility had been firmly established, they were questioned on empirical grounds. The problem with this questioning is that it is far from clear, how it could convincingly be shown that some of the phenomena under scrutiny do, or do not, exist in the real world. After all, what is at issue is the behaviour of the economic system as a whole, and the data situation on the basis of which the question could possibly be decided is perhaps not up to the problem at hand. In this respect, we will point out some of the difficulties to investigate the situation in terms of data taken from input-output tables.

Title: Pierangelo Garegnani and the revival of the â€˜submerged and forgottenâ€™ surplus approach 
Abstract: Garegnani stressed that the theory of distribution is the foundation stone of all economic analysis and he focused on the existence, within the history of economic analysis, of two alternative approaches to the theory of value and distribution, namely the classical and marginalist ones. The upshot of Garegnaniâ€™s work is that economic science had been driven off course not by Ricardoâ€™s classical approach but by Jevons, Marshall and Walras and that getting the discipline back on the right track requires the rediscovery and reactivation of the classical surplus approach that was abandoned in the mid-19th century. In this paper, some of the issues addressed by Garegnani to reactivate this approach will be discussed. They are the analytical method of the surplus approach, the relation between prices and outputs, and the implications of the phenomena of capital reversing and reswitching of techniques. Finally, some considerations on Garegnaniâ€™s interpretation of the labour theory of value and his analysis of exploitation will be advanced.

Title: None so deaf as those that will not hear: on Garegnaniâ€™s contributions to the capital-theoretic critique and the resistances to accepting them 
Abstract: In this paper I will discuss the usefulness of Garegnaniâ€™s contributions to the capital-theoretic criticism of marginalist/neoclassical theory trying also to indicate possible avenues for fruitful further work. Three main groups of critical contributions by Garegnani on capital theory are distinguished: 1) on the structure of the marginal approach to value and distribution and its differences from the classical or surplus approach; 2) criticisms of the traditional versions of the marginal approach; 3) criticisms of the neo-Walrasian versions. The content of the three groups of contributions is briefly remembered. It is suggested that Garegnani's arguments are increasingly accepted among historians of economic thought, and remain unaccepted among mainstream economists mainly because of a conscious decision not to study them: a disconcerting non-scientific attitude due to dogmatism and to political-ideological pressures. On Garegnani's 2000-2003 criticism of intertemporal equilibrium theory it is better to wait for a thorough examination of his unpublished manuscripts.

Title:  The Euler Equation Approach: Critical Implications of Recent Developments in the Theory of Intertemporal Choice 
Abstract:  The paper deals with the development of the mainstream theory of intertemporal choice based on the idea that 
individuals choose consumption and saving in order to maximize lifetime expected utility subject to an intertemporal budget 
constraint. This analytical framework rests on the theories developed in the 1950s by Modigliani and Friedman and revisited 
in the 1970s with the introduction of the rational expectations assumption. Starting with Hall (1978), the literature focused 
on testing the model relying on the first-order conditions of the optimization problem faced by the consumer — the Euler equation — 
and a number of empirical puzzles arose. Therefore, the subsequent decades were dedicated to progressively modifying the original model 
so as to render it able to explain the data. The paper argues that the introduction of highly specific assumptions, needed to reconcile 
theory and empirical evidence, has affected the generality of the implications that can be drawn from the model. Furthermore, the ever more 
substantial departure from the original formulation seems to have resulted in a gradual abandonment of the very premises on which the neoclassical 
approach to consumption analysis was built.

Title:  Revisiting the role and consequences of Econophysics from a Marxian perspective
Abstract:  The idea that economic phenomena are governed by stochasticity and uncertainty led to the extensive 
use of concepts and methods from the physical sciences that deal with non-deterministic patterns, giving rise 
to the multidisciplinary field of Econophysics. The last decade, several voices rose against it arguing that no 
new knowledge has been obtained and that the Econophysicists have merely ‘discovered’ what was already known in Economics. 
There also have been economists arguing that the mixture of physical models and economic ideas can still blossom and provide 
new insights into the study of Economics. In this paper, we attempt to reveal a different aspect of Econophysics, one that builds 
on its corroborative character and its role in criticizing neoclassical approach. In our view Econophysics can be used as a new enlarged 
version of Econometrics, as a set of methodologies to subject the economic models to logical and empirical tests. But, to do so, we argue, 
it is also necessary to ‘release’ this strict methodological research from any theoretical or ideological doctrine, including those neoclassical 
axioms so well incorporated in Economics. In view of this, we show that econophysical models by and large give further insights to discard the 
Marginalist paradigm point towards a different perception, closer to the old Classical and Marxian theories of political economy.

Title:  Investigating the Greek Unemployment from a Classical Perspective
Abstract:  This paper addresses the issue of unemployment in Greek economy from a Marxist perspective. 
Specifically, we focus on analysing the structure of the Greek labour market with respect to the results
of the memoranda and their relation to the current phase of capital accumulation. Rejecting the orthodox 
approaches to measuring and analysing unemployment, we first turn our focus to three indicators that are proposed 
by the BLS, calculating them in the case of the Greek labour market. Then, the three categories of stagnant, conjectural and 
latent reserve army are presented and respective unemployment rates are calculated for the Greek economy. Our conclusion is that 
the Marxian categories, not only capture the real dimension and size of the labour market, but they also contain information about 
changes in the labour force, that are not easily considered through the official indices.

Title:  Credit, money and economic growth: two volumes in honour of Lavoie and Seccareccia
Abstract:  This review article provides a brief outline of the content of
two recent volumes edited by Rochon and Bougrine in honour of Lavoie
and Seccareccia. Observations are then advanced on two points raised in
the two volumes, namely the effect of the monetary policies on income
distribution and the implications of the zero lower bound on the monetary
policy. Finally, some contributions focusing on secular stagnation are
commented on.
